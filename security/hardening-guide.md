## Security Controls

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization

#### Prompt Injection Defense
```yaml
defense_layers:
  layer_1_input_filtering:
    rules:
      - pattern: "ignore previous|forget everything|system prompt"
        action: "block"
        log: true
        alert: true
      
      - pattern: "admin mode|debug mode|developer access"
        action: "sanitize"
        replacement: "[BLOCKED]"
        log: true
      
      - pattern: "<script>|javascript:|onclick"
        action: "block"
        reason: "XSS attempt"
    
    implementation: |
      def validate_input(user_input):
          # Check against blocklist
          for pattern in BLOCKED_PATTERNS:
              if pattern.search(user_input):
                  log_security_event("blocked_input", pattern)
                  return None
          
          # Sanitize special characters
          sanitized = escape_special_chars(user_input)
          
          # Length validation
          if len(sanitized) > MAX_INPUT_LENGTH:
              sanitized = sanitized[:MAX_INPUT_LENGTH]
          
          return sanitized
