### 3. BMAD Method Reference (`bmad-method-reference/`)
**ðŸŒŸ BEST PRACTICES REFERENCE**

A complete clone of the official BMAD-METHOD repository showing professional-grade implementations:
- **10+ Production-Ready Agents**: Analyst, Architect, Developer, PM, QA, etc.
- **Multiple Team Configurations**: Fullstack, Backend-only, IDE-minimal
- **6 Complete Workflows**: Greenfield and Brownfield for UI, Service, and Fullstack
- **Expansion Packs**: Game development (Unity/Phaser) and Infrastructure/DevOps
- **Quality Standards**: Comprehensive checklists and templates

See `BMAD-REFERENCE.md` for detailed learning points and patterns.

## How to Use These Examples

### For Learning:
1. **Start with BMAD Reference**: Study the professional agent structures
2. **Review Context Preservation**: See how agents maintain state
3. **Examine Outputs**: Understand what deliverables look like

### For Creating Your Own:
1. **Copy Structure**: Use BMAD agents as templates
2. **Adapt Patterns**: Modify for your domain
3. **Follow Standards**: Match the quality level shown

### Quality Checklist:
- [ ] Agent structure matches BMAD examples
- [ ] Context preservation implemented
- [ ] Clear activation instructions
- [ ] Comprehensive command set
- [ ] Proper dependency management
- [ ] Domain-specific sections included
- [ ] LLM optimization patterns applied

## Key Patterns from Examples

### 1. Professional Agent Structure
```yaml
# From BMAD examples
- Clear ACTIVATION-NOTICE
- Complete YAML configuration
- Structured persona definition
- Comprehensive commands
- Domain-specific sections
```

### 2. Context Preservation
```yaml
# From agent-with-context-preservation.md
- Token threshold monitoring
- Event-based triggers
- Documentation levels
- Handoff protocols
```

### 3. Team Composition
```yaml
# From BMAD team configurations
- Core vs optional agents
- Role relationships
- Workflow assignments
- Clear deliverables
```

### 4. Workflow Organization
```yaml
# From BMAD workflows
- Phased approach
- Agent coordination
- Quality gates
- Clear outputs
```

## Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Completeness**: Every agent is fully defined
2. **Clarity**: Clear roles and boundaries
3. **Quality**: Built-in validation and checks
4. **Extensibility**: Expansion pack pattern
5. **Context Awareness**: State preservation
6. **User Focus**: Clear help and commands

## Quick Start

To create a new agent team based on these examples:

1. **Choose a Reference**:
   - For development teams: Use BMAD fullstack team
   - For service teams: Use BMAD service workflows
   - For specialized domains: Follow expansion pack pattern

2. **Copy and Adapt**:
   ```bash
   # Copy an agent template
   cp bmad-method-reference/bmad-core/agents/analyst.md ../agents/my-analyst.md
   
   # Modify for your domain
   # Update persona, commands, and domain sections
   ```

3. **Implement Context Preservation**:
   - Add triggers from `agent-with-context-preservation.md`
   - Include LLM patterns
   - Set up documentation levels

4. **Validate Quality**:
   - Compare against BMAD standards
   - Check all required sections
   - Test activation and commands
