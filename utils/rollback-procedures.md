## Rollback Prevention

### Best Practices
1. **Frequent Checkpoints**: Every significant milestone
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Before each phase
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Incremental changes
4. **Monitoring**: Continuous health checks
5. **Documentation**: Clear rollback procedures
6. **Practice**: Regular rollback drills
7. **Automation**: Scripted rollback procedures
8. **Communication**: Clear escalation paths

### Investment in Prevention
- Checkpoint system: 20 hours setup
- Automated testing: 40 hours development
- Monitoring dashboards: 30 hours configuration
- Rollback scripts: 20 hours creation
- Team training: 10 hours per person
- **Total: ~120 hours**
- **ROI: 10x in prevented failures**

Remember: The best rollback is the one you never have to use. Invest in prevention, but be prepared for recovery.
