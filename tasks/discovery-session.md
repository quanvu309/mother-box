# Discovery Session Task

Conduct comprehensive discovery session with user to understand their agent team needs. This is the critical first step in the Mother Box process.

## Process

### Step 1: Initial Context Gathering

Ask these foundational questions (one at a time, wait for responses):

1. What type of project or business are you working on?
2. What specific problems are you trying to solve with agents?
3. What's your current team size and structure?
4. What's your timeline for needing this agent team?

### Step 2: Problem Deep Dive

Based on initial answers, explore the problem space:

**For each problem identified:**
- What makes this problem challenging?
- How are you handling it currently?
- What would ideal solution look like?
- Who is affected by this problem?
- What's the cost of not solving it?

**KEY PRINCIPLE:** Use "Tell me more about..." to go deeper into interesting areas.

### Step 3: Domain Understanding

Understand the specific domain:

**Industry Context:**
- What industry/domain are you in?
- What regulations or standards apply?
- What specialized knowledge is required?
- What tools/systems are commonly used?

**Workflow Mapping:**
- Walk me through a typical workflow
- Where are the decision points?
- What approvals are needed?
- Where do delays typically occur?

### Step 4: Role Discovery

Identify needed agent roles:

**For each potential role:**
- What would this role do?
- What decisions would they make?
- What information do they need?
- Who would they interact with?
- What expertise must they have?

**Validation Questions:**
- Would a human in this role need special training?
- What would frustrate someone in this role?
- How would you measure their success?

### Step 5: Success Criteria Definition

Define what success looks like:

**Quantitative Metrics:**
- What metrics would improve?
- By how much?
- Over what timeframe?
- How will you measure?

**Qualitative Goals:**
- What would feel different?
- What new capabilities would you have?
- What would users say?
- What risks would be reduced?

### Step 6: Scope Refinement

Narrow to achievable scope:

**Prioritization:**
- If we could only solve one problem, which would it be?
- What's the minimum viable agent team?
- What could we add in phase 2?
- What's definitely out of scope?

**Constraints:**
- What technical constraints exist?
- What integration requirements?
- What compliance needs?
- What timeline pressures?

### Step 7: Synthesis and Validation

Summarize findings for confirmation:

**Present Back:**
"Let me confirm what I've understood..."
- Your domain: [specific]
- Main problems: [list]
- Key roles needed: [list]
- Success looks like: [specific]
- Constraints: [list]

**Get Confirmation:**
- "Does this capture your needs?"
- "What did I miss?"
- "What should I adjust?"

### Step 8: Research Questions

Identify what needs investigation:

**For Researcher:**
- Industry best practices for [X]
- Standard roles in [domain]
- Regulatory requirements for [Y]
- Common tools used for [Z]

**Documentation:**
If user confirms, document all findings in structured format for team reference.

## Elicitation Techniques

### Progressive Refinement
Start broad, systematically narrow:
- "Tell me about your business" → 
- "What are your main challenges?" →
- "Which challenge hurts most?" →
- "What specifically about it?"

### The Five Whys
Get to root causes:
- Why do you need agents? →
- Why is that important? →
- Why does that matter? →
- Continue until root revealed

### Scenario Exploration
Use concrete examples:
- "Walk me through yesterday..."
- "Show me a typical case..."
- "What happened last time..."

### Pain Point Analysis
Understand frustrations:
- "What wastes the most time?"
- "Where do errors occur?"
- "What do people complain about?"
- "What keeps you up at night?"

## Key Principles

- **LISTEN MORE THAN TALK**: Let user do 70% of talking
- **NO ASSUMPTIONS**: Verify everything explicitly
- **BUILD TRUST**: Show understanding before suggesting
- **STAY CURIOUS**: Every answer opens new questions
- **DOCUMENT EVERYTHING**: Capture all insights
- **VALIDATE CONSTANTLY**: Confirm understanding frequently

## Output Format

## Common Patterns to Watch For

### Vague Requirements
- User says: "I need automation"
- Dig deeper: "What specific tasks?"

### Solution Jumping
- User says: "I need 5 agents"
- Step back: "What problem are we solving?"

### Hidden Complexity
- User says: "Simple customer service"
- Probe: "What edge cases exist?"

### Unstated Assumptions
- User assumes: "Obviously it needs X"
- Clarify: "Tell me why X is important"
