## Research Tips

1. **Start Broad, Go Deep**: Overview first, then drill down
2. **Follow the Pain**: Problems reveal authentic needs
3. **Learn the Language**: Terminology = credibility
4. **Find the Edges**: Edge cases reveal true complexity
5. **Verify Everything**: Trust but verify all findings

## Remember

Good research creates agents that domain experts recognize as "one of us." The difference between generic and authentic lies in the depth of domain understanding. Research isn't complete until you could successfully impersonate someone from that domain in a conversation.
