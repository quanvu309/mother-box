## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes

Example:
```python
def create_agent(
    name: str,
    role: str,
    capabilities: List[str],
    personality: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
) -> Agent:
    """
    Create a new agent with specified characteristics.
    
    Args:
        name: The agent's unique identifier
        role: The agent's primary role
        capabilities: List of agent capabilities
        personality: Optional personality traits
        
    Returns:
        Agent: The newly created agent instance
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If name is empty or role is invalid
    """
    # Implementation here
```

### YAML Style
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Keep lines under 120 characters
- Use meaningful keys
- Add comments for complex structures

### Commit Messages
Follow the Conventional Commits specification:
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Include both positive and negative test cases

Example:
```python
def test_agent_creation_with_valid_data():
    """Test that an agent is created successfully with valid data."""
    agent = create_agent(
        name="test-agent",
        role="tester",
        capabilities=["testing", "validation"]
    )
    assert agent.name == "test-agent"
    assert agent.role == "tester"
    assert "testing" in agent.capabilities

def test_agent_creation_with_empty_name_raises_error():
    """Test that creating an agent with empty name raises ValueError."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Name cannot be empty"):
        create_agent(name="", role="tester", capabilities=[])
```
