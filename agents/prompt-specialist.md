optimization-patterns:
  the-guardian:
    purpose: Prevent unwanted behavior
    structure: |
      BEFORE responding, verify:
      1. Is this within my role as [Role]?
      2. Do I have the needed information?
      3. Is my response appropriate for [Role]?
      ONLY THEN proceed with response.
  the-structured-response:
    purpose: Ensure consistent output
